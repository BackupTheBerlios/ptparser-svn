Building Power Tab Parser Using Visual Studio 2003
==================================================


Step 1 - Installing and Setting Up wxWidgets
--------------------------------------------

1) The project relies on wxWidgets for it's GUI. You must download wxWidgets
2.4.2 for Windows from http://www.wxwidgets.org/. Version 2.4.2 is the only
version guaranteed to work, so don't download any other version.

2) Once installed, you'll need to setup an environmental path variable that's
required by the project:

a) Click Start -> Control Panel -> Performance and Maintenance -> System ->
Advanced Tab
b) Click Environment Variables
c) Under the System variables heading, click New
d) In the Variable name box, type WXWIN (must be capital letters)
e) In the Variable value box, enter the full path to the folder where wxWidgets
is installed. (i.e. C:\wxWindows-2.4.2)
f) Click OK
g) Click OK
h) Click OK


Step 2 - Building wxWidgets
---------------------------

1) In the folder where you installed wxWidgets, open the src folder, and then
double-click the wxWindows.dsw file so that the project opens in Visual
Studio. When it asks to convert the project, click Yes To All.

2) On the Build menu, click Batch Build.

3) Make sure there is a check in the Build column beside both configurations
(Debug/Release) for the following projects in the solution:

a) jpeg
b) png
c) regex
d) tiff
e) zlib

4) Make sure there is a check in the Build column beside the Debug and Release
configurations for the wxWindows project. (you don't need to check the DLL or
Unicode configurations, the parser project is statically linked)

5) Click the Build button and wait for the build to complete.


Step 3 - Building the XML Resource Library
------------------------------------------

1) In the folder where you installed wxWidgets, open the contrib\src\xrc folder
and click the XrcVC.dsw file so that the project opens in Visual Studio. When
it asks to convert the project, click Yes To All.

2) On the Build menu, click Batch Build.

3) Make sure there is a check in the Build column beside the Debug and Release
configurations for the XrcVc project. (you don't need to check the DLL
configurations, the parser project is statically linked)

4) Click the Build button and wait for the builds to complete.
